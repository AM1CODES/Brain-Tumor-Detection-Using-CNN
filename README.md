# Our Goal
We need to predict whether or not a person has brain tumor by using the different MRI scans that we are provided with. We need to build a classifier that can classify between the 3 types of tumor present in our data  and also tell us if a person does not have any tumor based on the images of the MRI scans.

# Some information about the Data set
The data set was taken from Kaggle which contains two folders, one is for training and the other is for testing. I split the training set into training and validation set. It has 3 types of Brain Tumor - Glioma, Meningioma and pituitary along with images of patients with no tumor.

These are the different images of the types of Tumor present in our data.

# Results
We were able to achieve an accuracy of 97% on the training set whereas on the validation set we have an accuracy of 95%. Overall the model is quite good considering the amount of data that was used to train it.
